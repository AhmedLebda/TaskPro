# "MERN" Stack Course"

This is a MERN project from a [youtube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0Zuz27SZ-6P4dQUsoDatjEGpmBpcOW8V)

Thanks to [Dave Gray](https://www.youtube.com/@DaveGrayTeachesCode)

## I have adapted the project concept while incorporating my own coding patterns and additional features, ensuring it aligns with the original course content while reflecting my unique approach and enhancements.
